# Optimization-Using-Gradient-Descent-Linear-Regression
In this assignment, I built a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. I also investigated three different approaches to this problem using NumPy and Scikit-Learn linear regression models, as well as constructing and optimization of the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.
